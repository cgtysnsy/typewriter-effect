Text Generate Effect
Also called Text Generate Effect, A Typewriter Effect is something where a piece of text constructs itself with some milliseconds in delay. You will see the text getting generated from start to finish. In this problem, create a Typewriter Effect from scratch using native React and/or Javascript functions.



User Stories:
When the user clicks on the Start Generating button, the sample text should start printing word by word.
There has to be a delay of 10 milliseconds while adding the keywords.
Clicking on Reset button should reset the window to its initial state.
Syntax highlighting for the code is NOT IMPORTANT. You can use a simple div element to make a container as well.
Once the user clicks on Start Generating - clicking on it should DO NOTHING, Until and unless the user clicks on Reset - they can they be able to re-run the effect.
There should be no memory leaks inside of your application.
There should be no infinite loops inside of your application.
The text can be anything, It doesnt have to be a code snippet.
